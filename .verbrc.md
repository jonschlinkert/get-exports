This is more of a linting tool for `export` statements than anything. Just type `ext` and the name of the file to read and the CLI will output a list of statements like `export.foo = foo';` for you to manually add to the file.

## Install
{%= include("install") %}

## Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Usage

### CLI

From the command line, just run:

```bash
exp [filename] > foo.txt
```
In `foo.txt` you should see something like (of course, with the names of the functions/methods in your application):

```js
exports.foo = foo;
exports.bar = bar;
exports.baz = baz;
```

I considered adding logic to append this to the file, but this is simple enough and gives you a chance to look things over before adding them to the file.


### API

To use with a node.js application, just do:

```js
var getExports = require('{%= name %}');
getExports('index.js');
```
Returns something like:

```js
exports.foo = foo;
exports.bar = bar;
exports.baz = baz;
```
